The page I've chosen is "Google.com"

There are two main user stories:

1- The guest user who has no account with google who is only going to be able to search for info in the search bar 
2- The registered user who is going to be able to log in and use the different google apps like: gmail, google drive, etc.

Both users will have "sub-users" which will have additional an additional user story. For example, there will be user that
will be interested on applying filters to their search or limiting the results to certain locations/languages os their interest.
The developer should also take that into consideration and make accesible this parameters to these sub-users who would like to apply
these specific parameters to their searchs.
